# CreateVM
This utility is made for VirtualBox Virtual Machine creation.  If you put this script in your 'Virtualbox VMs' folder along with your ISO files for VMs, you can create them using this simple shell script.

If you have any questions, comments, or would like to contribute please feel free to reach out.

Thank you,
